## üßê Motivation & Challenges


> My major motivation with the frontend was to learn more about React, especially different hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext and useParams. I also wanted to try to convert the code to TypeScript after I had time to work on it alone after my bootcamp ended. (The frontend was originally built in a 3.5 day sprint as pairs @ Rithm School). I was also really excited to explore authorization and authentication via token and local storage. I didn't focus so much on CSS, so it is a fairly bare bones app stylistically.
>
> As far as challenges, figuring out the TypeScript conversion was a struggle at first, as I wasn't sure exactly how deep I should go with typing. I used strict mode as my guide, and learned some new things about TypeScript as a whole. Another challenge was staying organized as we worked through the application. What helped immensely was building a component diagram.  

## üíª Tech Stack & Packages

**JavaScript | TypeScript | React | Bootstrap | React Testing Library |Jest**

```

## üß™ Testing

```shell
$ npm i --global jest (this is a global install, ignore if you have)

--- JEST COMMANDS ---
jest -i (runs all tests)
jest --coverage (shows coverage of app)
jest {name_of_file}.test.js (to run specific file)

```

### ‚òëÔ∏è To-Do's

- Add testing
- Add authO for login with google / indeed
- Add company login option, to post jobs and view applications
- Add a way to hold a resume / CV for frequent use
- Update styling to look presentable

- Connect the application feature

## üëâ Credits

> Jobly was built while attending Rithm School as part of a 6 day sprint (3 days for front and backend each). The frontend was built with @yukdev and backend was built with @meyerj. It was refactored after graduation, for efficiency and general code cleanup.
