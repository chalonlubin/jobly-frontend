## üßê Motivation & Challenges

---

> My major motivation with the frontend was to learn more about React, especially different hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext and useParams. I also wanted to try to convert the code to TypeScript after I had time to work on it alone after my bootcamp ended. (The frontend was originally built in a 3.5 day sprint as pairs @ Rithm School). I was also really excited to explore authorization and authentication via token and local storage. I didn't focus so much on CSS, so it is a fairly bare bones app stylistically.
>
> As far as challenges, figuring out the TypeScript conversion was a struggle at first, as I wasn't sure exactly how deeply I should go with typing. I used strict mode as my guide, and learned some new things about TypeScript as a whole.

## üíª Tech Stack & Packages

** JavaScript | TypeScript | React | Bootstrap | React Testing Library |Jest **

_react-dom | react-router-dom | axios | jsonwebtoken | react-toastify_

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

---

Here is a high level overview a few of the features I am proud of:

- Authentication and authorization handled in a secure way via local storage and token validation
- Passes TypeScript strict mode
- Varied uses of React Hooks
- Infinite Scroll

## üì¶ Install & Run

---

```shell

--- clone repo ---
cd into repo
npm install
npm start

Will be running on localhost 3000.
```

## üß™ Testing

---

```shell
$ npm i --global jest (this is a global install, ignore if you have)

--- JEST COMMANDS ---
jest -i (runs all tests)
jest --coverage (shows coverage of app)
jest {name_of_file}.test.js (to run specific file)

```

### ‚òëÔ∏è To-Do's

---

- Add testing. Order would be browser -> integration -> unit
- Add auth via google / facebook / github
- Add company login option, to post jobs and view applications
- Add a way to hold a resume / CV for frequent use
- Update styling to look presentable
- Refactor TypeScript

## üëâ Credits

---

> Jobly was built while attending Rithm School as part of a 6 day sprint (3 days for front and backend each). The frontend was built with @yukdev and backend was built with @meyerj. It was refactored after graduation, for efficiency and general code cleanup.
